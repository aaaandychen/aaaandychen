# Hi there, Nice to see you! 👋
🎓 Graduate student at the University of Science and Technology Beijing, focusing on distributed systems and artificial intelligence.

💼 I gained hands-on experience as a backend intern at DiDi Chuxing and Duxiaoman Financial and also build scalable backend services with Java and Go.

📚 I am currently diving deeper into machine learning as well and truly enjoy working in this field.

🌟 Looking forward to collaborating, learning, and contributing to open-source projects together!
